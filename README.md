# Optimization-Diet-Problem

The diet problem is one of the first large-scale optimization problems to be studied in practice. Back in the 1930’s and 40’s, the Army wanted to meet the nutritional
requirements of its soldiers while minimizing the cost

15-2-1.	An optimization model (a linear program) to find the cheapest diet that satisfies the maximum and minimum daily nutrition constraints using PuLP.

15-2-2-a. If a food is selected, then a minimum of 1/10 serving must be chosen.

15-2-2-b.	Many people dislike celery and frozen broccoli. So at most one, but not both, can be selected

15-2-2-c. To get day-to-day variety in protein, at least 3 kinds of meat/poultry/fish/eggs must be selected.
